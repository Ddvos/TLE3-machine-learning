## But what is a Neural Network?

# Javascript

Javascript is the language of the web, allowing easy deployment to an app or a website.

### K-Nearest-Neighbour

This is a very basic algorithm (similar to Pythagoras Theorem) where you use the distance between points to classify a new point. These two demos might help you understand the basics of training a model and classifying data, without needing a Neural Network or a complex library:

- [Using the 'k-nearest neighbour' algorithm to train a model](https://github.com/NathanEpstein/KNear)
- [Demo project using 'K-Nearest-Neighbour'](https://github.com/KokoDoko/webcam-detectotron)

### Neural Networks with BRAIN JS

[BrainJS](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) is a library that allows you to instantiate a Neural Network, train it and run a classification in just a few lines of code.

- [Source code and examples for BrainJS](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js)

### Neural Networks with TENSORFLOW JS

[TensorFlowJS](https://js.tensorflow.org) is the Javascript version of Google TensorFlow, and [ML5](https://ml5js.org) is a wrapper that makes TensorFlowJS a bit more accessible to beginners.

- [Hello World in Tensorflow.JS](https://dev.to/notwaldorf/hello-tensorflow-2lc5)

### Perceptron

A perceptron is a Neural Network that has only one cell. You can code it by hand in only about 20 lines of code. This will help you to understand what a Neural Network is actually doing:
